<h1>Quantum Circuit Engine for Pygame based Quantum Games</h1>

This is a Quantum Circuit Engine  for integrating Quantum Circuits to your pygame based quantum game. You can use it simply by creating an object of `QuantumCircuitGrid` class stored in `quantum_circuit.py` file.

This Quantum Circuit was originaly created for the **QPong Game** developed by <a href='https://huangjunye.github.io/' target='_blank'>Junye Huang</a> in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-VvodTkP_rfrs3RWdeWE9aNRD" target='_blank'>12 Days of Qiskit Program</a>. I created this engine by re-writing its code located <a href='https://github.com/QPong/qpong-livestream' target='_blank'>here</a> to make it modular and abstract for easy use with any quantum game. 

The feauteres I have included are:
- Modualar and Abstract Code.
- All configurations at one place in the `config.py` file.
- Developers can create Quantum Circuit for any number of qubit/wires and circuit width (max. number of gates which can be applied in a wire) of their choice. 
- Easy to change UI by replacing color configs and graphics for gates with those of your choice. 
- Easy to change size of Quantum Circuit by adjusting `QUANTUM_CIRCUIT_TILE_SIZE`, `GATE_TILE_WIDTH` and `GATE_TILE_HIEGHT` in the `config.py` file.
- Easily change controls by changing keys in the `handle_input()` method of the `QuantumCircuitGrid` class.

<h2>Usage</h2>

You can use it simply by creating an object of `QuantumCircuitGrid` class stored in `quantum_circuit.py` file. The constructor of `QuantumCircuitGrid` takes these values as argument:

- `position`: Position of the Quantum Circuit in the game window.
- `num_qubits`: Number of Qubits in the Quantum Circuit.
- `num_columns`: Circuit width (max. number of gates which can be applied in a wire) of their choice.

You can run your quantum circuit on BasicAer Simulator by using this function:
```python
def run_quantum_circuit(self, quantum_circuit):
        simulator = BasicAer.get_backend("statevector_simulator")
        quantum_circuit.measure_all()
        transpiled_circuit = transpile(quantum_circuit, simulator)
        counts = simulator.run(transpiled_circuit, shots=1).result().get_counts()
        measured_state = int(list(counts.keys())[0], 2)
        return measured_state
```

<h2>Configurations</h2>

All the configurations for Quantum Circuit can be done in the `config.py` file. The controls of the quantum circuit in the game can be changed from defaults mentioned below by changing keys in the `handle_input()` method of the `QuantumCircuitGrid` class.

- You can change size of Quantum Circuit by adjusting `QUANTUM_CIRCUIT_TILE_SIZE`, `GATE_TILE_WIDTH` and `GATE_TILE_HIEGHT` in the `config.py` file.
- You can change UI colors by replacing colors `QUANTUM_CIRCUIT_BG_COLOR`, `QUANTUM_CIRCUIT_WIRE_COLOR`, and `QUANTUM_GATE_PHASE_COLOR` in the `config.py` file.
- You can use custom graphics for gates by replacing the graphics in the `graphics/quantum_circuit_gates` folder with those of your choice.

<h2>Game Controls for Building Quantum Circuit</h2>

- **W, A, S, D Keys:** Move the "Circuit Cursor" in the Quantum Circuit to the place where you want to add a gate in the circuit.
- **Backspace Key:** Remove the gate present at the Circuit Cursor.
- **Delete Key:** Clear the Quantum Circuit, i.e., remove all gates from the Quantum Circuit.
- **X Key:** Add X Gate to the quantum circuit.
- **Y Key:** Add Y Gate to the quantum circuit.
- **Z Key:** Add Z Gate to the quantum circuit.
- **H Key:** Add H Gate to the quantum circuit.
- **C, R, E Keys:** Press **C Key** to convert the X, Y, Z, or H gates into CX, CY, CZ, and CH gates respectively, and then press **R Key** and **F Key** to the control to qubit above or below respectively.
- **Q and E Keys:** To convert X, Y, and Z into RX, RY, and RZ gates respectively. **Q Key** decreases the rotation angle by π/8 and **E Key** increases the rotation angle by π/8.
